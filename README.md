## 🚀 How It Works
1. The **Guesser** selects a secret number.  
2. Three **Players** try to guess the secret number.  
3. The **Umpire** compares the guesses:  
   - ✅ If all players guess correctly → **Game tied**  
   - ✅ If multiple players guess correctly → **Announce multiple winners**  
   - ✅ If one player guesses correctly → **Announce winner**  
   - ❌ If no one guesses correctly → **Game lost**
